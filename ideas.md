**Design Movement**: Neo-Brutalism meets Swiss Modernism

**Core Principles**:
- Raw, unpolished authenticity with bold geometric shapes
- Extreme contrast and unapologetic visual hierarchy
- Functional minimalism with unexpected playful elements
- Data-driven aesthetics reflecting technical expertise

**Color Philosophy**: 
High-contrast monochromatic base (stark black #0a0a0a on off-white #f5f5f0) with a single electric accent color (neon cyan #00ffcc) used sparingly for interactive elements and data highlights. The palette communicates technical precision while the cyan represents AI/digital innovation.

**Layout Paradigm**: 
Asymmetric grid with intentional "broken" sections—large bold typography overlapping content areas, offset columns that create visual tension, and diagonal section dividers that guide the eye through the narrative. No centered hero; instead, a side-anchored introduction with the professional photo bleeding off one edge.

**Signature Elements**:
- Thick, brutalist borders (8-12px) around key content blocks
- Monospace font for metrics and numbers to emphasize data
- Floating "tags" with sharp corners for skills/technologies
- Diagonal cut sections using CSS clip-path for dynamic transitions

**Interaction Philosophy**: 
Immediate, snappy responses with no easing curves—instant state changes that feel decisive and confident, mirroring the precision of technical SEO work. Hover states use scale transforms and the neon accent color.

**Animation**: 
Stagger-in animations on scroll with mechanical precision (no bounce, pure linear timing). Experience timeline entries appear sequentially with a typewriter effect on metrics. Section transitions use hard cuts with diagonal wipes.

**Typography System**:
- Display: Space Grotesk (700-900 weight) for headings—geometric, technical, bold
- Body: IBM Plex Mono (400-500) for all text—reinforces technical expertise
- Hierarchy: Extreme size contrast (72px headlines vs 14px body) with tight line-height (1.1-1.3)

**Design Movement**: Organic Modernism with Editorial Influence

**Core Principles**:
- Warm, human-centered design balancing professionalism with approachability
- Flowing, natural layouts inspired by magazine editorial design
- Subtle organic shapes and curves contrasting with structured content
- Emphasis on storytelling through visual rhythm and pacing

**Color Philosophy**: 
Earthy, sophisticated palette anchored by deep forest green (#1a4d2e) and warm terracotta (#c87941) with soft cream backgrounds (#faf8f3). Colors evoke growth, expertise, and natural progression—reflecting 15+ years of career evolution. Muted sage green (#8b9d83) for secondary elements creates depth without competing.

**Layout Paradigm**: 
Magazine-style multi-column layout with a flowing, organic grid. Content sections have varying widths and heights, creating natural reading rhythm. Large pull quotes and statistics break up text blocks. The professional photo is integrated into an organic blob shape (using border-radius: 60% 40% 65% 35%) that feels contemporary and approachable.

**Signature Elements**:
- Soft, organic blob shapes as background elements and photo frames
- Curved section dividers using SVG waves instead of straight lines
- Circular progress indicators for skills with gradient fills
- Handwritten-style accent font for section labels and highlights

**Interaction Philosophy**: 
Smooth, natural movements with gentle easing (cubic-bezier curves). Interactions feel fluid and responsive, like pages turning in a magazine. Hover states use subtle lift effects with soft shadows, creating depth without aggression.

**Animation**: 
Gentle fade-up animations with slight rotation (2-3 degrees) on scroll. Timeline entries slide in from alternating sides with smooth acceleration curves. Background blobs subtly morph and shift position on scroll, creating organic movement.

**Typography System**:
- Display: Fraunces (600-700 weight, soft serif) for headlines—elegant, editorial, distinctive
- Body: Outfit (300-400 weight, rounded sans) for text—modern, readable, friendly
- Hierarchy: Moderate contrast (48px headlines, 16px body) with generous line-height (1.6-1.8) for readability

**Design Movement**: Tech-Forward Minimalism with Kinetic Energy

**Core Principles**:
- Ultra-clean, spacious design with strategic moments of visual intensity
- Technology and AI as visual metaphors through gradients and glows
- Precision and sophistication through restrained design choices
- Dynamic energy conveyed through motion and light effects

**Color Philosophy**: 
Dark mode foundation (deep navy #0f172a as base) with luminous electric blue (#3b82f6) to cyan (#06b6d4) gradients representing AI/digital expertise. Subtle purple (#8b5cf6) accents for highlights. The palette evokes digital interfaces, neural networks, and cutting-edge technology while maintaining professional sophistication.

**Layout Paradigm**: 
Full-bleed sections with extreme vertical spacing. Horizontal scroll sections for experience timeline (desktop) that break the traditional vertical flow. Content floats in generous whitespace with intentional asymmetry—hero section pushes content to the left third, leaving two-thirds for a large gradient orb effect. Sticky navigation that transforms on scroll.

**Signature Elements**:
- Animated gradient meshes and orbs as background elements (CSS gradients with blur)
- Glowing borders on hover using box-shadow with blue/cyan colors
- Floating cards with frosted glass effect (backdrop-filter: blur)
- Animated particle system in hero section suggesting AI/data processing

**Interaction Philosophy**: 
Smooth, tech-inspired interactions with spring physics. Elements respond to cursor proximity with magnetic attraction effects. Micro-interactions everywhere—buttons pulse gently, cards lift and glow on hover, text reveals with shimmer effects.

**Animation**: 
Orchestrated entrance sequences with staggered timing. Hero elements fade in with scale and blur effects. Experience cards slide in horizontally with trailing glow effects. Gradient backgrounds slowly animate position (30s duration) creating subtle movement. Scroll-triggered parallax on background elements.

**Typography System**:
- Display: Sora (700-800 weight) for headlines—geometric, tech-forward, clean
- Body: Inter (400-500 weight) for text—but used strategically with generous spacing
- Accent: JetBrains Mono (500 weight) for metrics and technical details
- Hierarchy: Large headlines (64px) with wide letter-spacing (0.02em), 18px body with 1.7 line-height

## Selected Approach

**Tech-Forward Minimalism with Kinetic Energy** (Response 3)

This approach best represents Teodor's expertise in AI and SEO technology while maintaining professional sophistication. The dark mode with luminous gradients creates a modern, cutting-edge aesthetic that aligns with his specialization in LLMs and generative AI search. The kinetic energy through animations and interactions reflects the dynamic nature of the SEO field, while the ultra-clean minimalism ensures excellent user experience and readability.

The design will emphasize:
- Professional sophistication through restrained, spacious design
- Technical expertise through tech-inspired visual language (gradients, glows, particles)
- Career achievements through clear hierarchy and strategic emphasis on metrics
- Modern innovation through smooth animations and interactive elements
